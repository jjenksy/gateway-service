# Netflix OSS Zuul Gateway Service
The gateway service provides a single endpoint to navigate to all the services that are enabled in the Eureka server.
For example if you have the Gateway service running on port 9000 and a service registered with the Eureka server called service
then if you navigeted to http://localhost:9000/service then you would get root endpoint of that service served up for
consumption
